Based on the synthetic testing, here's what likely happens:

1. **fitted_params.trend**: This is a MODEL PARAMETER, not necessarily the actual
   slope of the generated time series. It's what the PyTorch model learned as the
   linear trend component during training.

2. **Actual slope**: This is the real slope of the fitted time series as plotted,
   which includes the effect of all components (trend + seasonal).

LIKELY ISSUE:
- When seasonal components are present, the actual slope of the fitted time series
  can differ from the pure trend parameter.
- This explains why trend lines "betray" their time series.

PROPOSED CAUTIOUS FIX:
Instead of:  trend_fitted = -fitted_rate * time_years
Use:         calculated_slope = np.polyfit(time_years, fitted_ts, 1)[0]
             trend_fitted = calculated_slope * time_years

This ensures the trend line ALWAYS matches the actual slope of the plotted time series.

VALIDATION NEEDED:
- Test this approach on a few stations from the actual figure
- Verify it fixes both subsiding and uplifting site issues
- Ensure it doesn't break anything else
